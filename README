Spreadsheet/ConvertAA version 0.01
==================================

This module allows you to convert from Spreadsheet column notation ( 'A', 'AZ', 'BC', ..) to decimal and back.

  my $baseAA = ToAA(475255) ;
  my $base10 = FromAA('AAAZ') ;

Base AA (the name I give to the column notation) doesn't have the 'zero' notion. There is certainly a better
and faster way to do the convertion.

The limit is 'ZZZZ' or 475255.
